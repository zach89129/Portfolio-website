# React Router Portfolio Homework

### Please fork and clone this repo and complete the steps outlined below: 

1. Create a Skeleton App with correct organization of folders/pages/and components
2. You need to have the following **Page** components: Login, SignUp, Profile, About, Skills, Contact Me
3. Each component has to render the title (i.e. ```<h1>Login</h1>```), and there should be sample data rendered in all components (Login and Signup can be left as forms). All data in your Page components need to be stored in state. Use Functional components only. 
4. You need to have a nav bar in App.js with all your links to each Page (Use the Link component from react-router-dom)
5. Create apropriate routes for each page in App.js using the Router component from react-router-dom (i.e. for /login, /signup etc.)
6. Please reference the React Router V6 lesson for help

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
